# P2MM-Discord-Bot
The Offical Discord Bot for the Portal 2: Multiplayer Mod Discord!

*Supports being run on Linux and Windows Operating Systems!*

**It is recommended to use the `stable` branch of this bot as the dev branch will or might be bugged and/or possibly broken.**

## Requirements:
- Python 3.10 or above
- Pip (Should be installed with Python, but if not, please install it)
- You must give credit if you fork this for your own purposes, NO CLOSED SOURCE!!!

*Recommendation for Linux!*
*If using Linux on a external server, I recommend using tmux.*
*tmux makes a new terminal instance not linked to whatever remote connection tool you are using to connect to your server.*
*That way when you disconnect from your server, the Discord bot won't shutdown.*

## Setup:
1. Download this repo's `stable` branch anywhere, easy pesy lemon sqweezy.
2. Create a json file named `config.json` or use the templateconfig.json file and rename it to config.json.
3. Inside the JSON you created, stick in the Client Token you get from the Discord Developer Portal, also change out the debug prefix if you want.
4. In the `.gitignore file`, make sure the `config.json` is not uploaded containing your Client Token, don't want anyone accessing your bot ey?
5. Run the `run_bot.bat` file if using Windows or the `run_bot.sh` file after chmoding it for Linux. This will also make sure all the python packages are also installed properly before running the bot.
6. Enjoy the P2MM Discord Bot! :D
