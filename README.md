# P2MM-Discord-Bot
The Offical Discord Bot for the Portal 2: Multiplayer Mod Discord!

*Supports being run on Linux and Windows Operating Systems!*

## Requirements:
- Python 3.10 or above
- Pip (Should be installed with Python, but if not, please install it)
- You must give credit if you fork this and use the code for your purposes, NO CLOSED SOURCE!!!

*Recommendation for Linux!*
*If using Linux on a external server I recommend using tmux.*
*tmux is makes a new terminal instance not linked to whatever remote connection tool you are using.*
*That way when you disconnect the Discord bot won't close down.*
## Setup:
1. Download this repo anywhere, easy pesy lemon sqweezy.
2. Create a json file named config.json or use the templateconfig.json file and rename it to config.json.
3. Inside stick in the Client Token you get from the Discord Developer Portal, also change out the debug prefix if you want.
4. In the .gitignore file, make sure the config.json is not uploaded containing your Client Token, don't want anyone accessing your bot ey?
5. Run the "run_bot.bat" file if using Windows or the "run_bot.sh" file after chmoding it for Linux.
6. Enjoy the P2MM Discord Bot! :D
